PETITION FOR SUSPECTED KIDNAPPING, CULTISM AND THREAT TO LIFE,
We the entire family of Umuokwurunaji of Umuagwu, Akabor Autonomous community, Oguta LGA Imo State hereby write for several threats to our lives by Mr. Malachy Nnawuihe Ejiofor and his gang of cult group which to our understanding has resulted to the kidnapping of our brother Mr. Okechukwu.

We went to our farm, Mr. Malachy came together with his gang of cult boys with a gun, axes and cutlass chased us out of our farms threatening to kill all of us if we ever set our feet in the land as he has claimed the place as meeting ground for his cult activities. We thought that it was a joke few days later our brother Mr. Okechukwu was kidnapped and ransom paid. We suspect that Mr. Malachy is responsible for this heinous crime. On several occasions it has been alleged in the village that he has a kidnapping syndicated and this latest incidence seems to confirm such allegation. He goes around threatening people with gun claiming that he will kill anyone, and nothing will happen that the police cannot save us because according to him all police stations in the entire Oguta LGA has been dismantled by his guys. He claimed to have guys everywhere including Agwa, Izombe, Egbema etc. He has bragged that he has a native doctor somewhere around Egbema that takes care of his charms and other fetish activities.
Some of the members of his group include……………………………………………………..
